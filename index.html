      <em>A rose window is often used as a generic term applied to a circular window, but is especially used for those divided into segments by stone mullions and tracery, with simple spokes radiating from a central opening.</em>

      The <em>Open Space Observatory</em> work for <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/the-future-starts-here" target="_blank">The Future Starts Here</a> exhibition provides a view into data received by the open source satellite ground station network, <a href="https://satnogs.org/" target="_blank">SatNOGS</a>. With over 20 stations distributed globally, the decentralized network of ground stations submits satellite telemetry and meterological data to a standardized, open <a href="https://satnogs.org/" target="_blank">platform</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The installation captures real-time data from the constellation of Low Earth orbit satellites tracked by the ground stations&#8212;a decentralized window into critical and newly accessible infrastructure.
